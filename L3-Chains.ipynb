The angle of incidence (the angle at which the light hits the mirror) will be equal to the angle of reflection (the angle at which the light bounces off the mirror). This is known as the law of reflection.\\n\\nAnother way to test reflection of light is to use a laser pointer and shine it at a smooth surface, such as a piece of glass or water. The laser beam will reflect off the surface and create a clear reflection of the beam. This can help demonstrate how light reflects off different surfaces.'"
